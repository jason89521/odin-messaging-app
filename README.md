# Odin Messaging App

This repository is a learning project for exploring backend development with JavaScript, based on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-messaging-app). It also serves as an opportunity to experiment with Vue.js on the frontend.

## Project Overview

The main focus of this project was to get hands-on experience with backend technologies. Many features, such as JWT storage, CSRF token handling, and handling user disconnections, have not been fully implemented. The primary goal was to understand the basics of backend development without delving too deeply into every aspect.

## Technologies Used

- **Socket.io**: For real-time communication between clients and the server.
- **PostgreSQL**: As the database for storing user data and messages.
- **Prisma**: An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool to interact with the PostgreSQL database.
- **Express**: A web framework for Node.js used to build the backend API.
- **Vue**: A progressive JavaScript framework used for building the frontend.
- **Vite**: A build tool that provides a faster and leaner development experience for Vue.js.
